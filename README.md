# XO Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game, also known as XO game, using React and TypeScript.
The game is built using the following technologies:

* React for the UI
* TypeScript for type safety
* Vite for development and build
* ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting

The game is built as a single page application, and it does not require any server-side rendering or API calls. The game state is stored in the React component state, and it is updated on each move.

The game is designed to be responsive, and it should work on any device with a modern web browser.

The game is also designed to be accessible, and it should be usable by anyone with a modern web browser, including people with disabilities.

The game is built using the following features:

* React Hooks for state management
* React Context for game state management
* React Memo for memoization
* TypeScript for type safety
* Vite for development and build
* ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting

The game is tested using Jest and React Testing Library.

The game is deployed on Vercel, and it can be accessed at [https://xo-game.vercel.app](https://xo-game.vercel.app).

The source code is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/michalzaq12/xo-game](https://github.com/michalzaq12/xo-game).
